# Down-to-Zero-II-DATA-STRUCTURE-MEDIUM.This solution finds the minimum operations to reduce a number to 0 using BFS or dynamic programming, where each operation can either subtract 1 or replace the number with the maximum of its two factors, efficiently exploring all possible reduction paths to find the shortest one.
